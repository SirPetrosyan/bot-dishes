    dolma: `Ingredients
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    2 onions, minced
    1 ½ cups uncooked white rice
    1 1/2 cups hot water, or as needed to cover
    2 tablespoons tomato paste
    2 tablespoons dried currants
    2 tablespoons pine nuts
    1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
    1 tablespoon dried mint
    1 tablespoon dried dill weed
    1 teaspoon ground allspice
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed in warm water
    
    Instructions:
  Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice, then add enough hot water to cover. Cover and simmer until rice is halfway cooked, about 10 minutes.
  
  Remove from the heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts, cinnamon, mint, dill, allspice, and cumin. Let mixture cool, about 15 minutes.
  
  Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; this will protect the dolmas from direct heat during steaming.
  
  Cut off and discard any grape leaf stems. Place about 1 teaspoon cooled rice mixture into the center of a leaf. Fold in the sides, then roll into a cigar shape. Place into the prepared pot. Repeat to make remaining dolmas.
  
  Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked. Check the water level often and add more as necessary.`,
  
  khash: `Ingredients:
  Cows feet (trotters) washed, patted dry, picked over for stray hairs and split in two - 3
  Crushed garlic - 30 cloves
  Warm flatbread (such as soft lavash or pita bread, for serving)
  Salt - to taste
  Chopped parsley - 1 cup
  Chopped cilantro - 1 cup
  Sliced lemons - 2
  Sliced radishes - 1 cup
  Sliced pickles - to taste
  Fresh chillis - to taste
  
  Instructions:
  Take a large bowl and place the trotters in it a day prior to cooking. Make sure to cover it with water and keep the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 10 and up to 48 hours. Keep in mind to change the water every two hours or so for the initial 10 hours.
  
  Transfer the trotters to a heavy-bottomed pot. Remember to cover it with 2 inches of water. Over a high flame, bring it to a boil.
  
  After the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to a simmer and allow it to cook for 40 minutes. Remember to keep the pot uncovered.
  
  Once done, strain the water, shift the trotters back to the pot and cover them with 2 inches of fresh water. Boil it over high heat, reduce the flame to a simmer, and allow it to cook for about 6 to 8 hours. Keep the container uncovered. Make sure to keep pouring water every hour or two. Continue until the trotters tend to become soft and tender.
  
  Take the mortar or a small bowl containing garlic and add 2 cups of hot broth to it. Mix well to combine.
  
  Serve the residual broth and meat instantly, passing salt, garlic mixture, and other garnishes. People in Armenia generally suggest 4-6 cloves’ worth per person.
  
  Khash can be stored in a refrigerator for up to four days. And if you need to heat it before consuming it, you can keep it on a simmer for about 20 minutes.

  harisa: `Ingredients:
  4 cups (960ml) homemade or store-bought chicken stock
  1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut in half crosswise, or boneless lamb stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes (see note)
  1 1/2 cups (276g) pearled farro (see note)
  1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
  6 tablespoons (85g) butter
  4 tablespoons (60g) olive oil
  2 tablespoons (16g) Aleppo pepper (see note)
  Lavash, for serving (optional)
  
  Directions
  For the Stovetop: Combine broth, 2 cups (480 ml) water, chicken (or lamb), farro, and salt in a Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Cover pot and reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is creamy and thick and grains easily compress under a spatula, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. You will need to stir more frequently toward the end of the cooking process. Skip to step 4.
  
  For a Pressure Cooker: Place broth, 1 cup (240 ml) water, chicken (or lamb or beef), farro, and salt in a pressure cooker. Seal and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat, if using a stovetop model, or by setting to pressure-cooker mode on an electric multi-cooker. Cook at high pressure for 40 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure (if using a stovetop pressure cooker; electric ones will automatically regulate the heat and pressure level).
  
  Allow cooker to depressurize naturally (about 15 minutes), then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you.
  
  Using a potato masher, vigorously mash mixture until the majority of chicken pieces are reduced to fine shreds and the harissa is very thick and starchy, about 2 minutes. (If you have an immersion blender, you can speed things along by blending the mixture for about 30 seconds and then finishing with potato masher.) Season with additional salt to taste.
  
  In a small saucepan, heat butter and oil over medium-high heat until foamy. Continue to cook, swirling pan, until milk solids in butter turn a deep hazelnut brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add Aleppo pepper (don't be alarmed; butter will foam and fizzle when pepper is added), swirling to coat.
  
  Spoon harissa into bowls, drizzle with spiced brown butter, and serve (with lavash on side, if including).`,
  
  lahmacun: `Ingredients
  1 lb. ground beef, lamb, or combination of both.
  1 medium onion (finely chopped)
  1 medium red pepper (finely chopped)
  1/2 small green pepper (finely chopped)
  1/2 bunch parsley ( washed well, finely chopped)
  1 15-oz. can diced tomatoes (well-drained)
  2 Tbsp. tomato or red pepper paste
  1-2 Tbsp. flour
  1½ tsp. dried mint
  1 clove garlic (minced)
  1½ tsp. salt
  1 tsp. sweet paprika
  1 dash cayenne pepper (or to taste)
  Base
  2 10-count pkgs. 8-inch flour tortillas
  
  Instructions 
  To save time, process the onion, peppers, and parsley in a food processor, using the metal “S” blade. Squeeze out any excess liquid – this is VERY important! Be careful not to over-process. Vegetables should still be a bit chunky, not pureed.
  
  In a large bowl, combine all of the topping ingredients, mixing well.
  
  Preheat oven to 400° – 425°F.
  
  Thinly spread about 3 Tbsp. of meat topping on the suface of each tortilla, spreading to the edge.
  
  Place 2 to 3 tortillas on each baking tray. They should not overlap each other.
  
  Bake on the lower rack for about 5 minutes, then on the upper rack, for another 5 minutes, or until the meat topping has browned, and the edges of the tortilla are golden.
  
  Continue this procedure until topping and/or tortillas are all used.`,
  
  gata: `Ingredients
  For the Dough:
  10 ounces (2 cups plus 2 tablespoons; 285g) all-purpose flour
  1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) instant yeast 
  1/8 teaspoon baking soda
  2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or same weight
  5 ounces (10 tablespoons; 140g) unsalted butter, softened
  2 ounces (about 1/4 cup; 60g) sugar 
  5 ounces (about 2/3 cup; 140g) plain Greek yogurt (whole or low-fat)
  1 large egg (55g), lightly beaten
  For the Filling:
  3 ounces (85g) walnuts, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped
  2 1/2 ounces (about 1/2 cup; 70g) all-purpose flour
  2 ounces (about 1/4 cup; 60g) sugar
  1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or same weight
  2 ounces (4 tablespoons; 60g) unsalted butter, melted
  2 teaspoons (10ml) vanilla extract
  To Finish and Bake:
  
  1 large egg, lightly beaten with a pinch of salt
  
  Instructions: 
  For the Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, yeast, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, using a stiff rubber spatula, vigorously stir butter and sugar together to form a uniform paste. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; wipe out bowl that had flour mixture, lightly grease with cooking spray or butter, and set aside. Using spatula followed by hands, mix flour and butter mixtures together until even, cornmeal-like mixture forms, 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Add yogurt and egg, and, using spatula followed by hands, stir until stiff, even dough forms, about 2 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared lightly greased medium bowl and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, and up to 16 hours.
  
  For the Filling: In a medium bowl, stir together walnuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and vanilla extract and, using a rubber spatula, stir until clumpy paste forms and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Cover and store at room temperature until ready to assemble.
  
  To Finish and Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer dough to clean, lightly-floured surface, and dust top of dough lightly with flour. Using hands, gently press dough into even 6-inch circle, adding flour to both sides of dough as needed to prevent sticking, while pinching closed any major cracks in dough that form. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick.
  
  Place filling in center of dough and, using clean hands and rubber spatula, spread into an even 5-inch round disc, leaving a 3 1/2-inch border of dough on all sides. Starting at one edge, using your hands, fold and pleat dough over filling toward center, working your way around disc. Pinch and press pleats together to fully enclose filling. Press top of dough gently to form an even 6-inch round. Invert so seam side is facing down and, using a rolling pin, gently roll into an even 9-inch round. Carefully transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat.
  
  Pinch dough around the edge of the gata between the index finger of one hand and thumb and index finger of the other hand to form decorative points, spaced about 1 inch apart. Brush top and sides of gata evenly with egg wash. Using a fork, drag flat underside of fork across top of gata to form grooved lines in a crisscross pattern, spaced about 1 inch apart. Using a toothpick, poke 8 to 10 evenly spaced holes in top of dough, stopping when you reach the filling. Bake until evenly golden brown, 28 to 35 minutes, rotating baking sheet after 20 minutes.
  
  Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let gata cool for at least 20 minutes. Slice into wedges, and serve.`,
  
  pakhlava: `Ingredients:
  4 cups of flour
  0.7 pound (300 grams) of butter
  4 eggs
  0.7 pound (300 grams) of sour cream
  2 cups of sugar
  0.7 pound (300 grams) of walnuts
  1 teaspoon of baking soda
  3 to 4 tablespoons of natural honey
  
  Instructions
  Place flour in a bowl. Make a small hole in the flour with a knife and put the sliced butter into the hole.
  
  Mix everything with a knife until the flour forms crumbs.
  
  Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the sour cream. Separate egg whites from yolks. Make a hole in the flour once again and add 3 egg yolks (don't add whites; you'll need them in a little while), sour cream, and water.
  
  Mix everything and knead the dough. The dough should be stiff and soft at the same time. Divide it into 3 parts (one of them a little bit bigger than the rest), and put them into the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
  
  While the dough is resting, make the filling. Chop walnuts with a knife (you can use a blender or grinder, but I don't recommend it, as the taste will be slightly different).
  
  Mix chopped walnuts with sugar; whip the egg whites (4 eggs) lightly(!)
  
  When the dough is ready, take it out, and roll each piece of the dough, making it approximately 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeters) thick.
  
  Put the dough layer into the baking pan and brush it with the lightly whipped egg whites. Add half of the filling (put it evenly on the whole layer).
  
  Put another layer on top of it and repeat (brush with egg whites and add the rest of the filling evenly).
  
  Now roll out the biggest piece of the dough, then put it on top and wrap all the edges down.
  
  Brush baklava with yolk and cut it into pieces (don't cut all the way, just the top layer). You can decorate each piece with walnut halves
  
  Put baklava into the COLD OVEN. Heat the oven with the baklava inside to 400°F to 430°F (200°C to 220°C). Once it's heated, bake for 30 minutes or until the crust is golden.
  
  Remove the baklava from the oven and brush it with honey (especially the cuts and the walnuts).
  
  Put it back in the oven for 5 minutes.
  
  Cool it, cut it into pieces, and enjoy!
